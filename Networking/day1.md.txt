# Networking Lab – Day 1

**Date:** 2026-01-06  
**Objective:** Basic network configuration and verification in a lab environment.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Checked IP configuration on the host machine**  
   - Verified IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
   - Confirmed network adapter type and connection status.

2. **Configured virtual network adapters in VirtualBox**  
   - Set both VM network adapters to **Bridged Adapter** (Realtek).  
   - Verified connectivity between host and guest VMs.

3. **Tested network connectivity**  
   - Successfully pinged the Windows Server VM from the client VM.  
   - Verified DNS resolution using `nslookup` for assigned server IPs.  

4. **Documented network settings**  
   - Screenshots attached:
     - `IP Configuration on Client VM`
     - `VirtualBox Network Adapter Settings`
     - `Ping test from client to server`

## Observations / Notes

- Host-to-VM ping works with Bridged Adapter.
- DNS configuration requires correct server IP; misconfigured IP can result in public DNS (e.g., 75.75.75.75) showing instead of internal server IP.
- Lab reinforces understanding of:
  - Network adapter types (NAT vs. Bridged vs. Host-only)
  - IP assignment and verification
  - Basic troubleshooting with `ping` and `nslookup`

## Next Steps

- Configure internal DNS for Active Directory domain (`corp.local`) and test name resolution from client VM.
- Continue documenting results in `Day2.md` for networking lab progression.
